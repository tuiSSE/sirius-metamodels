# Sirius Metamodel Diagrams
This project contains an _almost_ readable graphical representation of the [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius) Diagrams.

They were extracted from Eclipse Sirius version 6.3.1.202006101101.

To quickly see the diagrams, just look at the png files in the [pics](https://github.com/tuiSSE/sirius-metamodels/tree/master/pics) folder. Otherwise, import the whole project in an eclipse modeling as an "Existing project" and open the representation files to see the diagrams interactively.

More information about the metamodels' structure can be found [here](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/developer/Meta-models.html "Sirius Developer Doc").
